A few years ago I started using an application for macOS called [Focus](https://heyfocus.com), which allows you
to block applications and websites for a period of time.

On getting a new laptop, I never got round to installing it, despite its usefulness.

## The negativity rabbit hole.  

With the recent COVID-19 pandemic (leaving a note for those reading this post in 20 years from now and not being born yet), it has become
extremely difficult to avoid a constant flow of negative news. While it is certainly important to know what is going on,
the media currently has a very strong focus on making sure every article is negative.
 
<br/>

I'm sure it's not easy to find
positivity amongst everything going on, yet at the same time, I'm even more certain many don't even try. Bad news makes great headlines. Headlines sell!  
Of course one should wonder what it is anyone is actually selling these days given we're all confined to our homes and consumer economy around the world has essentially shut down. That's another matter however.

<br/>

This constant negativity can end up draining you emotionally and mentally. I recently found myself in this situation. I'd get up in the morning, read the news,
and already this would set me up in a bad spot. I'd start work, forget for a while, and yet during every pause, I'd check Twitter or some news site and then 
end up again with negative emotions. 

<br/>

I decided it was time to stop, which is where Focus came to the rescue.  

<br/>
I've now installed Focus again and have a schedule that blocks certain applications and websites from 7 am in the morning until 5 pm.

You can add as many websites as you like, albeit it already comes with a good list (of bad habits) to begin with.

## Is it working? 

For now, it seems to be, yes! I can tell you that in the past 2-3 weeks since I've installed it, not only has my mood improved, but I also feel like I'm getting more done.
Focus in fact allows me to take small breaks (up to 30 minutes during the entire period). Initially I found I was using this to its maximum extent, but
now I end up around 5 pm with nearly 30 minutes of break available. About the only time I do use the break is if I need to access Twitter for some reason.

<br/>
Of course, I can still use my phone to access any site (and Twitter), but again I've found that not having that habit of "let me just open up a news site while I'm waiting 
for this to build", has really helped me. 

<br/>
Many of you may not need, as you may have a native application to your mind called discipline. But for those of us that sometimes struggle, I'd suggest you give it a try!
