I have a series of online courses available on different training platforms

### Kotlin Course on O'Reilly

Over 8 hours of contents on Kotlin. From the very basics to advanced topics such as coroutines. The courses are available either for direct purchase or via Safari Online

### HTTP/2 Course on Pluralsight

If you're interested in HTTP/2 you might want to check out my course on Pluralsight. The course starts explaining why the need for HTTP/2 all the way to understanding what you, as a developer,
will need to know

* [HTTP/2 Fundamentals](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/http2-fundamentals)

### ExpressJS Course on Pluralsight

If you're doing Node development and interested in the ExpressJS framework, then checkout this complete course I did about express.js. Although it's several years old, most of the contents is still valid

* [Web Development with ExpressJS](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/expressjs)


## More courses

I have more courses planned, so make sure you check this page regularly for contents. In addition I have a [ton of videos](https://vimeo.com/search?q=hadi+hariri) [freely available](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hadi+hariri) online covering a variety 
 of topics from many conferences.
